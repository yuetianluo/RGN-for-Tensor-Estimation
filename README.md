# Low-rank Tensor Estimation via Riemannian Gauss-Newton

Here we include code for paper "Low-rank Tensor Estimation via Riemannian Gauss-Newton: Statistical Optimality and Second-Order Convergence
" by Yuetian Luo and Anru R. Zhang (https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.12031). See README.md for the instruction.

This folder includes R codes of Riemannian Gauss-Newton for tensor regression, rank-one tensor sensing, tensor completion and tensor decomposition and Matlab code for tensor regression. For each example, we also include an example code and those file names are ended with 'example'.

The R codes of Riemannian Gauss-Newton for tensor regression, rank-one tensor sensing, tensor completion and tensor decomposition are given in the 'RGN_Funs.R' file.

The Matlab code for tensor regression is given in 'RGN_tensor_regression.m'. Here the Tensor Toolbox for Matlab needs to be installed first (https://www.tensortoolbox.org/).

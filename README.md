Here we include Matlab and R codes for paper "Low-rank Tensor Estimation via Riemannian Gauss-Newton: Statistical Optimality and Second-Order Convergence
" by Yuetian Luo and Anru R. Zhang (https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.12031). See README.md for the instruction.

This folder includes R codes of Riemannian Gauss-Newton for tensor regression, rank-one tensor sensing, tensor completion and tensor decomposition and Matlab codes for tensor regression, rank-one tensor sensing and tensor completion. For each example, we also include an example code and those file names are ended with 'example'.

The R codes of Riemannian Gauss-Newton for tensor regression, rank-one tensor sensing, tensor completion and tensor decomposition are given in the 'RGN_Funs.R' file and the Matlab codes for tensor regression, rank-one tensor sensing and tensor completion are given in 'RGN_tensor_regression.m', 'RGN_rank_one_sensing.m', 'RGN_tensor_completion.m', respectively.  Here the Tensor Toolbox for Matlab needs to be installed first (https://www.tensortoolbox.org/).

Codes that illustrate the perfomance of our algorithm in tensor regression, rank-one tensor sensing and tensor completion are provided in 'RGN_tenregression_prop.R', 'RGN_tenreg_rankone_prop.R' and 'RGN_tensor_completion_prop.R'.
